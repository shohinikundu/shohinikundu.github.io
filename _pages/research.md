   I investigate how covenants, intrinsic to Collateralized Loan Obligation (CLO) indentures, provide a mechanism through which idiosyncratic shocks may amplify, imposing negative externalities on other unrelated firms in CLO portfolios. I exploit cross-sectional variation in firms' exposures to the Oil &amp; Gas (O&amp;G) industry through CLOs, as well as the timing of the O&amp;G price plunge in 2014, to study how non-O&amp;G firms in CLO portfolios are affected. When CLOs are subject to idiosyncratic shocks that push them closer to their covenant thresholds, they fire-sell unrelated loans in the secondary loan market to alleviate their constraints. These fire sales exert price pressure across security markets. The market dislocations erode the liquidity positions of exposed firms, spilling into real economic activity. Contrary to traditional fire sale settings, I find CLOs fire-sell loans issued by riskier firms for contractual arbitrage purposes -- exploiting loopholes in the design of covenants. The sample period for this study is 2013-2015, a relatively benign macroeconomic period. However, the results suggest the effects may be larger during times of stress, including the outset of the COVID-19 pandemic.


 * [**Fire Sales in Closed-End Funds**](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3595416)

   Closed-end funds are thought to have negligible fire sale risk as they have stable funding. This paper documents fire sale risk in closed-end funds. I show that covenants intrinsic to Collateralized Loan Obligation (CLO) contracts impose externalities on asset prices. Covenants are intended to mitigate agency costs. However, they can induce CLO managers to preemptively sell loans issued by distressed firms before the firms file for bankruptcy. These sales generate price pressure around bankruptcy default events. Constrained CLOs experience significantly lower cumulative returns relative to unconstrained CLOs. Hence, the remediation designed to address the agency problem in closed-end funds creates fire sale risk, like in open-end funds.


 * [**The Anatomy of Collateralized Loan Obligations: On the Origins of Covenants and Contract Design**](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3740092)

   This paper provides a dissection of the Collateralized Loan Obligation (CLO) market and examines the significance of covenants in facilitating the provision of credit. Since the Great Financial Crisis of 2008, the leveraged loan market has witnessed unprecedented growth. CLOs play an increasingly central role in the provision of credit to corporations, holding as much as 75% of all new institutional leveraged loans, as reported in 2019. The rise of the leveraged loan and CLO markets have attracted the attention of central banks which have been concerned with both the growth of the market and the opaque nature of interconnections between intermediaries, leveraged borrowers, and investors. Despite their increasing importance, little is understood about CLO intermediaries. In this paper, I describe the agency frictions inherent in the CLO market, and discuss how optimal contracts are derived with covenants that curtail such frictions. In addition, I describe the general macroeconomic milieu that has facilitated the rapid growth of the CLO market as well as recent changes that have developed. Understanding the structural aspects and dynamics of CLOs intermediaries, situated between investors and loan syndicates, is paramount for analysis of the innards of the market, the role of covenants, and developing insights into the shadow banking sector as well as other securitizations.

## Idiosyncratic Shocks and Aggregate Fluctuations


 * [**Banking Networks and Economic Growth: From Idiosyncratic Shocks to Aggregate Fluctuations** (with Nishant Vats)](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3556299)

   The objective of this paper is to explore the transmission of non-capital shocks through banking networks. We develop a methodology to construct non-capital (real) shocks, idiosyncratic shocks, using labor productivity shocks to large firms. We document a change in the relationship between (foreign) idiosyncratic shocks in state j and (domestic) economic growth in state i between 1978 and 2000 wherein the relation changes from positive to negative over this period. We show that the contemporaneous changes in banking integration across states is a key driver of this phenomenon. This is driven by geographically diversified banks diverting funds away from economies experiencing negative shocks towards other unaffected economies. This result operates through changes in bank loan supply. Our instrumental variable estimates suggest that a 1% increase in the bank loan supply is associated with a 0.05-0.26 pp increase in economic growth. Lastly, we argue that this mechanism can explain the decrease in covariance of state-level fluctuations, potentially explaining the Great Moderation, the period of relatively low aggregate volatility.
   
 * [**The Deposits Channel of Aggregate Fluctuations** (with Seongjin Park and Nishant Vats)](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3883605)

   This paper presents a new mechanism through which the geography of bank deposits increases financial fragility. We document within-bank geographic concentration of deposits -- 30% of bank deposits are concentrated in a single county. We combine this within-bank geographic concentration of deposits with local natural-disaster-induced property damages to construct novel bank deposit shocks. On aggregate, these shocks can explain 3.30% of variation in economic growth. Local disaster shocks result in aggregate fluctuations through their effect on deposits, which negatively affect bank lending. Financial frictions such as regulatory constraints, informational advantages, and borrower constraints are critical for the aggregation of shocks.

 * [**What Explains Geographic Variation in Corporate Investment?** (with Nishant Vats)](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3851008)

   We show that history can explain the geographic concentration of investment over and above traditional agglomerative forces, geography, and expectations. We use spatial variation in direct and indirect British rule to identify differences in historical circumstances. Using this within-country variation in historical circumstances, combined with a local identification approach and instrumental variable strategy, we explain the spatial differences in investment. Differences in historical origins can explain 13% of total geographic variation in investment. Moreover, investment is 8-10% lower in direct ruled areas. Our results indicate that history can have long-run consequences through its effect on economic organizations and state capacity.
