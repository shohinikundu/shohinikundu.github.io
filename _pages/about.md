### PhD Candidate in Finance

I am a PhD candidate at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business. My primary research interests are financial intermediation, regulation, and macroeconomics. I have a secondary interest in entrepreneurship and emerging market finance. 

I am currently on the job market and will be available for interviews during the 2021 ASSA Annual Meeting.
