I am an **assistant professor of finance** at the <a href="https://www.anderson.ucla.edu/" style="color:rgb(0, 0, 128); text-decoration: none;">**UCLA Anderson School of Management**</a>, **assistant professor of law** (by courtesy) at the <a href="https://law.ucla.edu/" style="color:rgb(0, 0, 128); text-decoration: none;">**UCLA School of Law**</a>, and **research affiliate** at <a href="https://cepr.org/" style="color:rgb(0, 0, 128); text-decoration: none;">CEPR</a>. 

My research interests lie in the triad of (I) financial intermediation and macroeconomics, (II) security design and externalities of financial contracts, and (III) emerging market finance.
