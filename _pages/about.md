I am an **Assistant Professor of Finance** at the <a href="https://www.anderson.ucla.edu/" style="color:rgb(0, 0, 128); text-decoration: none;">**UCLA Anderson School of Management**</a>, an **Assistant Professor of Law** (by courtesy) at the <a href="https://law.ucla.edu/" style="color:rgb(0, 0, 128); text-decoration: none;">**UCLA School of Law**</a>, and a **Research Affiliate** at <a href="https://cepr.org/" style="color:rgb(0, 0, 128); text-decoration: none;">**CEPR**</a>. 

My research interests are centered on three main areas: (I) financial intermediation and macroeconomics, (II) security design and externalities of financial contracts, and (III) emerging market finance.
