I am a recent PhD from the University of Chicago Booth School of Business. My primary research interests are financial intermediation, regulation, corporate finance, and macroeconomics. I have a secondary interest in entrepreneurship and emerging market finance. 

I will be joining the UCLA Anderson School of Management as an Assistant Professor of Finance from July 2021.
